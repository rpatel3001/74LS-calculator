# 74LS-calculator
A three function, 8 bit calculator with 2 digit hex displays and memory.

This project is entirely implemented using 74LS series chips that are currently on the market during summer 2018. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are implemented. Two input registers are settable using DIP switches. Results can be stored in a memory register, and then recalled to either input register. Two digit hex displays show the stored value in the two input registers, the memory register, and the result of the selected arithmetic function. 

This was intended to be implemented as a hardware device, but the cost is prohibitive on my budget. Maybe a simplified version will be built. Building it in logisim was a useful exercise in itself, though.
